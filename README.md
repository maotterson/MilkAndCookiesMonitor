# MilkAndCookiesMonitor
A supplementary application designed to plug into containerized environments to visualize applications running on the same network in one dashboard (e.g databases, API endpoints).


## Implementation
The image is designed to be "pluggable" in an existing container environment through environment variables in your orchestrator's manifest (e.g. docker-compose).
